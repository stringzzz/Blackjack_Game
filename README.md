# Blackjack_Game

I thought I was going to wait a little longer after making the "Threes Dice Game" project, but the idea of this one kept floating around in my head. It is a simple Blackjack game that the player plays against the computer dealer. Of course, it could be expanded on by making some animations for actually drawing the cards and all that, but I am still pretty happy with it as is.

This is somewhat of a precursor to a web game I want to make using my fan-made Nintendo card game. I will likely be using similar techniques from this one to make the card game into an actual video game where you play against the computer and all that. It will definitely be more complicated than this blackjack game, but it is definitely a future goal of mine.
